## Inspiration

As students interested in virtual reality and finance, we wanted to bridge the gap between work and play. Now you can keep track of your investment portfolio while engrossed in the world of virtual reality.

## What it does

Displays live stock information, portfolio performance diagrams, and relevant news about your securities.

## How we built it

We used the Unity platform to develop a virtual world meant to be experienced through an Oculus Rift. Live data is taken from the BlackRock Hackathon (Aladdin) API as well as Yahoo Finance, and processed through Python scripts before reaching the C# back-end of the virtual reality world.

## Challenges we ran into

We had no prior experience with Unity and virtual reality development, so we had to learn how to most effectively utilize these tools for our project. For example, creating virtual reality graphs in Unity required creative use of the tools we had at our disposal.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud that we were able to overcome many of the challenges we encountered during the development of VeloRes, and that we learned so much along the way.

## What we learned

We learned how to use the Unity game engine, and how to develop virtual reality applications to solve real-world problems. In addition, we gained additional C# and Python experience, as well as knowledge about passing data between the two platforms.

## What's next for ValoRes

We are interested in creating a more interactive user experience and expanding the functionality of ValoRes from an informational portal to a management system.

## Built With

Unity, C#, Python

## Dependencies

VRTK, Steam VR, Oculus Utilities for Unity
